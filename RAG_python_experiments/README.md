## Files:

- `rag_qa_llama_markdown_node_parser_bge_reranker.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook implementing RAG QA using the Llama model, markdown node parser, and BGE reranker for improved retrieval.

- `rag_qa_recursive_chunking_pinecone_db.py`: A Python script demonstrating RAG QA with recursive chunking strategies and integration with Pinecone vector database.

- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages and dependencies for running the experiments.

## Setup

To run the experiments, first install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you can execute the notebook or run the Python script as needed.
